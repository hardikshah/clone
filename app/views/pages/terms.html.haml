				The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and 
				twopickles.org and govern your use of the Service, superceding 
				any prior agreements between you and twopickles.org. The TOU 
				and the relationship between you and twopickles.org shall be 
				governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to 
				its conflict of law provisions. You and twopickles.org agree 
				to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the 
				courts located within the city of Atlanta, Georgia. The failure 
				of twopickles.org to exercise or enforce any right or provision 
				of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or 
				provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of 
				competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless 
				agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the 
				parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other 
				provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree 
				that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim 
				or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the 
				Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such 
				claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
		%li
			VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
			%p
				Please report any violations of the TOU by emailing to: 
				info@twopickles.org
			%p
				Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others 
				does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or 
				similar breaches.
			%p
				You understand and agree that, because damages are often 
				difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for 
				twopickles.org to pursue legal action to enforce these Terms, 
				you will be liable to pay twopickles.org the following amounts 
				as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates 
				of twopickles.org's damages for the specified breaches of 
				these Terms:
			%p
				a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or 
				entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your 
				affiliation with a person or entity; or (3) that includes 
				personal or identifying information about another person without 
				that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay twopickles.org 
				one thousand dollars ($1000) for each such message. This 
				provision does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful 
				non-deceptive parody of public figures.
			%p
				b. If twopickles.org establishes limits on the frequency with 
				which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to 
				or use of the Service, you agree to pay twopickles.org one 
				thousand dollars ($1000) for each message posted in excess of 
				such limits or for each day on which you access twopickles.org 
				in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.
			%p
				c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to 
				twopickles.org email addresses or through twopickles.org 
				computer systems, you agree to pay twopickles.org one thousand 
				dollars ($1000) for each such email.
			%p
				d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as 
				described above, you agree to pay twopickles.org one thousand 
				dollars ($1000) for each Item of Content posted. In its sole 
				discretion, twopickles.org may elect to issue a warning before 
				assessing damages.
			%p
				e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation 
				of the TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause 
				(d), you agree to pay twopickles.org one thousand dollars 
				($1000) for each and every Item you post in violation of the 
				TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party 
				engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the 
				"Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent 
				in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay twopickles.org an 
				additional one thousand dollars ($1000) for each Item posted by 
				the Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal in violation of 
				the TOU.
			%p
				f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or 
				otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your 
				own Content) in violation of these Terms without 
				twopickles.org's express written permission, you agree to pay 
				twopickles.org one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day on 
				which you engage in such conduct.
			%p
				Otherwise, you agree to pay twopickles.org's actual damages, to 
				the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. 
				Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, 
				twopickles.org retains the right to seek the remedy of specific 
				performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a 
				preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any
